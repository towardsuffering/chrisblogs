## Introduction to Coin Flip Simulation in R

Hey everyone! Today, we're going to do a quick simulation of flipping a coin 500 times using R. This simple script will help us understand some basics of data manipulation and random sampling. Let's get started!

## Ensuring Reproducibility with set.seed()

First, let's set a random seed:

```r
set.seed(123, sample.kind="Rejection")  # set random seed
```

This ensures our "random" results are reproducible. Always run this immediately before generating random numbers.

## Simulating Coin Flips with sample()

Now let's simulate our coin flips:

```r
coinFlips <- sample(c("Heads","Tails"), size=500, replace=TRUE)
```

What's happening here?

- We're creating a variable called `coinFlips`
- We use `sample()` to randomly pick between "Heads" and "Tails"
- We do this 500 times (`size=500`)
- `replace=TRUE` means each flip is independent (like in real life)

Think of it as R flipping a coin for us 500 times and writing down each result.

Now, let's see what we've got:

```r
str(coinFlips)
```

<OutputDisplay>

**chr [1:500] "Tails" "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Tails" "Heads" "Tails" ...**

</OutputDisplay>

What does this tell us?

- `chr` means we're dealing with character data (text)
- `[1:500]` shows that our vector has 500 elements, numbered from 1 to 500
- We can see the first few results: "Tails", "Heads", "Tails", etc.

This `str()` function is super handy. It gives us a quick summary of our data's structure. Always a good idea to check this after you create a new dataset!

## Accessing Specific Elements with Indexing

Curious about the 15th flip? Easy:

```r
coinFlips[15]
```

In R, we use square brackets `[]` for indexing. This notation is super useful:

- `coinFlips[15]` gives us the 15th element of our vector
- We can also use it to get multiple elements: `coinFlips[c(1, 15, 30)]` would give us the 1st, 15th, and 30th flips
- Or a range: `coinFlips[1:10]` gives us the first 10 flips

## Counting Occurrences with sum() and length()

Let's count how many times we got "Tails":

```r
sum(coinFlips=="Tails")
length(coinFlips[coinFlips=="Tails"])
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 239**</OutputDisplay>

Both lines do the same thing, but in different ways:

- The first line uses `sum()` to add up all the "Tails" (`TRUE` becomes 1, `FALSE` becomes 0)
- The second line uses bracket notation for subsetting, then counts the result:
  1. `coinFlips=="Tails"` checks each flip against "Tails", creating a `TRUE`/`FALSE` list
  2. `coinFlips[coinFlips=="Tails"]` keeps only the "Tails" flips
  3. `length()` counts how many "Tails" we have after this filtering

Want to know the proportion of "Tails"? Just divide by the total number of flips:

```r
sum(coinFlips=="Tails") / length(coinFlips)
```

<OutputDisplay>

**[1] 0.478**

</OutputDisplay>

This gives us the percentage of "Tails" in decimal form (multiply by 100 for a percentage).

## Analyzing Odd and Even Flip Patterns with Subsetting

Let's get a bit fancier and compare odd-numbered flips to even-numbered ones:

```r
oddFlips <- coinFlips[seq(1, length(coinFlips), 2)]
evenFlips <- coinFlips[seq(2, length(coinFlips), 2)]

sum(oddFlips=="Tails")
sum(evenFlips=="Tails")
```

Here's what we're doing:

1. We separate odd and even flips using `seq()` to create indices.
2. We count "Tails" in each group using `sum()`.

This shows us if there's any difference between odd and even flips, which we wouldn't expect in a fair coin toss.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! We've just simulated 500 coin flips and analyzed the results using R. From setting a seed for reproducibility to comparing subsets of our data, we've covered some fundamental techniques in data manipulation and analysis.

Remember, these same principles apply whether you're flipping coins or analyzing complex datasets. The beauty of R lies in its ability to handle both with ease.

## Next Steps

Ready to dive deeper? Try these:

1. Increase the number of flips to 10,000. Do the results change?
2. Simulate a biased coin. How would you modify the `sample()` function?
3. Visualize your results using R's plotting functions.

Keep experimenting, and happy coding!
