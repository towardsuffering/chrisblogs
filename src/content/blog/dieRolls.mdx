In this post, we'll explore three simple R programming examples that demonstrate basic data manipulation and analysis techniques. These examples are great for beginners learning R and provide a foundation for more complex analyses.

## 1. Generating a Sequence

Let's create a sequence of the first 30 multiples of 8:

```r
aVec <- seq(from=8, by=8, length.out=30)
print(head(aVec))
mean(aVec)
```

<OutputDisplay>[1] 8 16 24 32 40 48 [1] 124</OutputDisplay>

This code creates a sequence starting at 8, increasing by 8 each time, with 30 numbers in total. The mean of this sequence is 124.

## 2. Simulating Die Rolls

Now, let's simulate rolling a six-sided die 500 times:

```r
set.seed(1234)
rolls <- sample(1:6, size=500, replace=TRUE)
sum((rolls > 1) & (rolls < 6))
```

<OutputDisplay>[1] 326</OutputDisplay>

This simulation shows that out of 500 rolls, 326 were between 2 and 5 (inclusive).

## 3. Analyzing Random Numbers

Finally, let's generate 1000 random numbers between 1 and 100:

```r
set.seed(1234)
numVec <- floor(runif(1000, min=1, max=101))

# How many less than 50?
sum(numVec < 50)

# How many between 40 and 60?
sum((numVec > 40) & (numVec < 60))

# Standard deviation of numbers less than 40
sd(numVec[numVec < 40])
```

<OutputDisplay>[1] 476 [1] 185 [1] 11.20581</OutputDisplay>

This analysis shows that:

- 476 numbers are less than 50
- 185 numbers are between 41 and 59
- The standard deviation of numbers less than 40 is about 11.21

## Conclusion

These examples demonstrate basic R functions for:

1. Generating sequences
2. Simulating random events
3. Analyzing sets of numbers

They provide a starting point for understanding how R can be used for data manipulation and analysis.

## Next Steps

Try modifying these examples to see how the results change!
