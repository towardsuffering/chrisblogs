## Introduction to Data Manipulation in R

Hey everyone! Today, we're diving into some practical data manipulation techniques using R. We'll create a random vector, calculate summary statistics, count specific values, and explore how to "winsorize" data using both vectorized operations and loops. Let's get started!

## Creating a Random Vector with `rnorm()`

First, let's generate a random vector of 1,000 elements from a normal distribution:

```r
set.seed(123)  # Set random seed
aVector <- rnorm(n=1000, mean=0, sd=1)  # Create a random vector
head(aVector, 10)  # View first 10 elements
```

<OutputDisplay>

[1] -0.56047565 -0.23017749 1.55870831 0.07050839 0.12928774 1.71506499
[7] 0.46091621 -1.26506123 -0.68685285 -0.44566197

</OutputDisplay>
What's happening here?

- `set.seed(123)` ensures our random numbers are reproducible.
- `rnorm()` generates random numbers from a normal distribution.
- `n=1000` specifies we want 1,000 numbers.
- `mean=0` and `sd=1` set the mean and standard deviation of our distribution.
- The result is stored in `aVector`.
- `head(aVector, 10)` shows us the first 10 elements of our vector.

The output shows 10 random numbers. They're centered around 0 (our specified mean) and mostly fall between -2 and 2, which is expected for a standard normal distribution.

## Calculating Summary Statistics with `mean()` and `sd()`

Next, let's calculate the mean and standard deviation of our vector:

```r
mean(aVector)
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.01612787**</OutputDisplay>

```r
sd(aVector)
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.991695**</OutputDisplay>

What's happening here?

- `mean(aVector)` calculates the average of all numbers in `aVector`.
- `sd(aVector)` calculates the standard deviation, which measures the spread of the data.
- The mean (0.01612787) is very close to our target of 0.
- The standard deviation (0.991695) is very close to our target of 1.

These results confirm that our random vector closely matches the normal distribution parameters we set (mean=0, sd=1).

## Counting Values Based on Conditions

Now, let's determine how many elements in our vector are greater than 1, less than -1, or either:

```r
sum(aVector > 1)  # Count of elements greater than 1
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 157**</OutputDisplay>
```r sum(aVector > 1) / length(aVector) # Proportion of elements greater than 1 ```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.157**</OutputDisplay>

```r
sum(aVector < -1)  # Count of elements less than -1
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 165**</OutputDisplay>

```r
sum(aVector < -1) / length(aVector)  # Proportion of elements less than -1
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.165**</OutputDisplay>

```r
sum((aVector > 1) | (aVector < -1))  # Count of elements either greater than 1 or less than -1
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 322**</OutputDisplay>

```r
sum((aVector > 1) | (aVector < -1)) / length(aVector)  # Proportion of elements either greater than 1 or less than -1
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.322**</OutputDisplay>

What's happening here?

- 157 elements (15.7%) are greater than 1.
- 165 elements (16.5%) are less than -1.
- In total, 322 elements (32.2%) are either greater than 1 or less than -1.
- These proportions are close to what we'd expect in a standard normal distribution, where approximately 31.7% of the data should fall outside the range [-1, 1].

## Winsorizing the Data with Vectorized Operations

"Winsorizing" is a technique where extreme values are capped at a specified threshold. Let's cap all values greater than 1 to 1 and those less than -1 to -1:

```r
aVector.w <- aVector  # Create a copy of aVector
aVector.w[aVector.w > 1] <- 1  # Cap values greater than 1
aVector.w[aVector.w < -1] <- -1  # Cap values less than -1
mean(aVector.w)  # Mean of winsorized data
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.008593319**</OutputDisplay>
What's happening here?

- We create a copy of `aVector` to preserve the original data.
- Values greater than 1 are capped at 1, and values less than -1 are capped at -1.
- The mean of the winsorized data (0.008593319) is slightly different from the original mean (0.01612787).
- This difference is because we've modified the extreme values, which shifts the average slightly.

## Winsorizing the Data with a For Loop

Alternatively, you can use a for loop to achieve the same result:

```r
aVector.w2 <- aVector  # Create another copy of aVector
for (i in 1:length(aVector.w2)) {
  if (aVector.w2[i] > 1) {
    aVector.w2[i] <- 1
  } else if (aVector.w2[i] < -1) {
    aVector.w2[i] <- -1
  }
}
mean(aVector.w2)  # Mean of winsorized data using the for loop
```

<OutputDisplay>**[1] 0.008593319**</OutputDisplay>

What's happening here?

- We create another copy of `aVector`.
- The `for` loop goes through each element of `aVector.w2`.
- If an element is > 1, it's set to 1. If it's < -1, it's set to -1.
- This achieves the same result as the vectorized operation, but less efficiently.
- The mean (0.008593319) is identical to our previous winsorization result, confirming both methods work the same way.

## Conclusion

And there you have it! We've explored different ways to manipulate and analyze data in R. From generating random data and calculating summary statistics to counting specific values and winsorizing data, we've covered several essential techniques that are widely applicable in data analysis.

Remember, mastering these basic R operations is key to handling more complex datasets effectively. Keep practicing, and soon you'll be able to manipulate data with ease!

## Next Steps

Ready to expand your R skills further? Try these exercises:

1. Experiment with different thresholds for winsorizing. How does this affect the mean?
2. Use R's `ifelse()` function to perform conditional operations in a more compact form.
3. Visualize the original and winsorized data to see the effects of winsorizing.

Happy coding!
